# Globis Code Completion
This VSCode extension combines Servoy and Globis autocompletions.

For Servoy globals this works by parsing the xml containing the docs, pulled from a Servoy Developer IDE .jar file.

Autocompletions for the Globis codebase are generated by walking the top-level function statements and variable declarations, mapping their name, eventual parameternames and then matching them against parsed JSDoc, which (hopefully) accompanies the code written by and for Globis, for variable, parameter and return types.

## Install Extension
- Download the latest or specific version from the release tab on the right of the main repository page.
- Open the command palette in VSCode (`ctrl+shift+p`) and select *Extensions: Install from VSIX...*
- Select the downloaded file et voila

## Usage
This extension will (for now) work in any saved `.js` file.
In projects without the Globis codebase, it will provide you with the Servoy objects like `databaseManager` as autocomplete suggestions.

In the `globis-online` workspace, it will find any and all `globals.js` files and parse them into typings, stored as JSON in `.globis_typings/globis_json` folder at the root of the workspace.
From there the containing functions and variables will be present on the `globals` Servoy object.

## Build Extension
To build this extension from source:
- Clone the repo
- In the root of the repo, run `npm install` to install the needed packages.
- Run `npm run package` to create the `.vsix` file, which is the extension.
- Install via Command Palette or by right-clicking the `.vsix` file in VSCode itself and clicking Install.
